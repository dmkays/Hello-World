# Hello-World
# Repository for files I create while learning the basics of a few new languages.
# I coded in C for a living from 1983-91. Haven't done much since.
# I am trying to come up to speed with Python, PowerShell, Java, Perl and maybe a couple others.
# Then I will decide which is best to achieve my goals.
